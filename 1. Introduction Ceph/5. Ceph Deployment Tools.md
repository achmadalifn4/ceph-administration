# Ceph Deployment Tools

Deploying Ceph in a production environment requires choosing the right deployment tool for your infrastructure and workflow. Several deployment tools are available, each with its own advantages and considerations. Below are some of the most commonly used tools to deploy and manage Ceph clusters.

## 1. **Cephadm**
Cephadm is a deployment tool designed to install and manage Ceph clusters using **containers** (Podman or Docker) and **systemd**, providing tight integration with the **CLI** and **dashboard GUI**.

- **Supported Ceph Releases**: Only supports **Octopus** and newer releases.
- **Key Features**:
  - Fully integrated with the **orchestration API**.
  - Supports the new **CLI** and **dashboard** features for managing cluster deployment.
  - Requires **container support** (Podman or Docker) and **Python 3**.
  - Ideal for users seeking a containerized deployment with systemd integration.

**Recommendation**: Cephadm is the preferred tool if you're using **Octopus** or later versions, especially for users who want containerized deployments and seamless integration with the new management APIs.

## 2. **Rook**
Rook is an open-source operator that deploys and manages Ceph clusters within **Kubernetes**. It allows users to manage storage resources, provision Ceph clusters, and connect an existing Ceph storage cluster to Kubernetes via Kubernetes APIs.

- **Supported Ceph Releases**: Supports **Nautilus** and newer releases.
- **Key Features**:
  - Preferred method for running **Ceph on Kubernetes** or connecting Kubernetes clusters to an existing Ceph cluster.
  - Integrates with the **new orchestrator API**.
  - Fully supports the new management features in the **CLI** and **dashboard**.
  - Enables seamless provisioning and management of Ceph storage resources via Kubernetes.

**Recommendation**: If you are running Ceph within a **Kubernetes environment**, or need to connect an existing Ceph cluster to Kubernetes, **Rook** is the preferred tool.

## 3. **ceph-ansible**
ceph-ansible uses **Ansible** to deploy and manage Ceph clusters. It is a widely used tool for automating the deployment process of Ceph clusters.

- **Supported Ceph Releases**: Compatible with all Ceph releases but does not integrate with the new orchestrator APIs (introduced in Nautilus and Octopus).
- **Key Features**:
  - **Widely deployed** and trusted for Ceph cluster automation.
  - Not integrated with the new orchestrator APIs, which means newer **management features** and **dashboard integration** are not available.
  - Uses **Ansible** playbooks to manage deployments, making it suitable for environments that already use Ansible for automation.

**Recommendation**: Choose **ceph-ansible** if you have existing experience with **Ansible** or require an automated deployment process, but are okay with not having full integration with the latest Ceph management APIs.

## 4. **ceph-salt**
ceph-salt deploys Ceph clusters using **Salt** and **cephadm**. This tool combines the power of **Salt** automation with the capabilities of **cephadm** for containerized management.

- **Supported Ceph Releases**: Compatible with **Nautilus** and newer.
- **Key Features**:
  - Integrates **Salt** and **cephadm** for a containerized deployment.
  - Useful for users who prefer SaltStack for automation in their environment.
  
**Recommendation**: **ceph-salt** is recommended for users who are already using **SaltStack** for automation and wish to combine it with **cephadm** for containerized management.

## 5. **Juju (jaas.ai/ceph-mon)**
**Juju** is a deployment and management tool that uses **charms** to deploy and manage Ceph clusters. **jaas.ai/ceph-mon** is the charm that installs Ceph using Juju.

- **Supported Ceph Releases**: Generally supports multiple releases, but compatibility may vary.
- **Key Features**:
  - Provides a **charm-based** deployment approach.
  - Ideal for users who are already using **Juju** for managing infrastructure.
  - Flexible and suitable for **cloud environments** such as **OpenStack** or **Microservices**.

**Recommendation**: If you are already using **Juju** in your environment or are working with **cloud-native** deployments, **Juju charms** are a good option for deploying Ceph.

## 6. **Puppet (github.com/openstack/puppet-ceph)**
**Puppet** can be used to deploy and manage Ceph clusters via the **puppet-ceph** module, allowing users to automate the deployment of Ceph using Puppet's configuration management.

- **Supported Ceph Releases**: Compatible with multiple Ceph releases.
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses **Puppet** for automating configuration and management.
  - Suitable for environments that already use **Puppet** for infrastructure management.

**Recommendation**: Choose **Puppet** if your environment already uses **Puppet** for configuration management and automation.

## Summary of Tools

| **Tool**          | **Supported Releases**    | **Key Features**                                         | **Ideal For**                                       |
|-------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **cephadm**       | Octopus and newer         | Containerized deployment, CLI and dashboard integration | Users who need containerized deployment with systemd integration |
| **Rook**          | Nautilus and newer        | Ceph in Kubernetes, integrates with Kubernetes APIs     | Running Ceph on Kubernetes or connecting Kubernetes to Ceph |
| **ceph-ansible**  | All releases              | Automated deployment using Ansible                      | Users who need automation but don't need latest orchestrator APIs |
| **ceph-salt**     | Nautilus and newer        | Salt automation with containerized management           | Users who prefer SaltStack for automation            |
| **Juju**          | Varies                    | Cloud-native deployments with Juju charms               | Users already using Juju or deploying in cloud environments |
| **Puppet**        | Varies                    | Configuration management with Puppet                    | Users already using Puppet for infrastructure management |

## Conclusion

The right deployment tool depends on your environment, automation preferences, and Ceph release version. If you are working with **Kubernetes**, **Rook** is the preferred tool. For **containerized** deployments with **systemd** integration, **cephadm** is ideal. **ceph-ansible**, **ceph-salt**, **Juju**, and **Puppet** are suitable for users already leveraging automation tools in their infrastructure.
