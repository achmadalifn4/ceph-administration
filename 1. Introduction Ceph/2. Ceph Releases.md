# Ceph Releases

Ceph follows a stable release cycle that starts with the **Nautilus** release (14.2.0), which introduced a new naming and versioning convention. Each stable release series is named after a species of cephalopod, and the version number follows a three-part system: `x.y.z`, where:

- **x** represents the release cycle (e.g., 13 for Mimic, since 'M' is the 13th letter of the alphabet).
- **y** indicates the release type:
  - **x.0.z** - Development releases (for early testers).
  - **x.1.z** - Release candidates (for test clusters).
  - **x.2.z** - Stable or bugfix releases (recommended for general users).

This versioning convention was introduced starting with the **Infernalis** cycle (version 9.y.z). Prior to that, versions followed a simpler `0.y` for development releases and `0.y.z` for stable series.

### Release Types and Versioning

1. **x.0.z - Development Releases**: Intended for early testers and those who want to experiment with cutting-edge features. These versions may be unstable and should not be used in production environments.
   
2. **x.1.z - Release Candidates**: Released for test clusters and brave users who want to evaluate new features before the stable version is available. These are relatively stable but still under active testing.

3. **x.2.z - Stable/Bugfix Releases**: These are the stable releases intended for production environments. They include bug fixes and minor improvements. This is the recommended version for most users.

### Ceph Release Naming Convention

Each Ceph release is named after a species of cephalopod, often using common names to make them easier to remember. The names follow the alphabetical order, starting from **Argonaut** and continuing with subsequent letters of the alphabet.

- **Example**: 
  - **Mimic** (13.x series) is named after a mimic octopus.
  - **Nautilus** (14.x series) is named after the nautilus shell.
  - **Reef** (18.x series) is named after the reef octopus.

This naming convention makes it easier for users to identify which release they're working with and to track the evolution of Ceph over time.
