# Ceph OS Recommendations

When deploying Ceph, it's essential to choose a suitable operating system (OS) that meets Ceph's requirements for kernel and system initialization. As a general guideline, Ceph is recommended to run on newer releases of Linux with Long-Term Support (LTS) versions, as these ensure stability, security, and compatibility for production environments.

## Ceph Dependencies

### **Ceph Kernel Client**

If you plan to use the kernel client to map **RBD (RADOS Block Devices)** or mount **CephFS**, it's important to select a "stable" or "longterm maintenance" kernel series. You can find such kernels on the [kernel.org](http://kernel.org) website or from your Linux distribution's official repositories. Here are some general guidelines:

- **For RBD (RADOS Block Devices)**:
  - Ceph recommends using at least **4.19**-based "longterm maintenance" kernel series.
  - If possible, use a **newer "stable"** or **"longterm maintenance" kernel series**.
  
- **For CephFS (Ceph File System)**:
  - Refer to the section on [Mounting CephFS using Kernel Driver](#) for kernel version guidance specific to CephFS.

### **Kernel Version Requirements**

Older kernel versions may not support newer features in Ceph or may require you to disable certain features, such as CRUSH tunables profiles. For **RBD**, a minimum kernel version of **5.3** or **CentOS 8.2** is necessary for reasonable support of RBD image features.

## Supported Platforms

Ceph is generally distribution-agnostic, meaning it can run on any Linux distribution that meets the kernel and system initialization requirements (e.g., `sysvinit` or `systemd`). However, Ceph does provide packages and has tested the software on certain Linux distributions. Below is a compatibility chart showing the supported platforms for each Ceph release:

| **Ceph Release Name** | **CentOS**    | **Ubuntu**       | **OpenSUSE**  | **Debian** |
|-----------------------|---------------|------------------|---------------|------------|
| **Quincy (17.2.x)**    | 8A            | 20.04A           | 15.3          | 11         |
| **Pacific (16.2.x)**   | 8A            | 18.04C, 20.04A   | 15.2          | 10,11      |
| **Octopus (15.2.x)**   | 7B, 8A        | 18.04C, 20.04A   | 15.2          | 10         |

**Key Notes**:
- **A**: Ceph provides packages and has conducted comprehensive tests on these versions.
- **B**: Ceph provides packages with basic testing on these versions.
- **C**: Ceph provides packages only, with no official testing conducted.

## Ceph's Platform Independence

Ceph does not require a specific Linux distribution. It can be deployed on any distribution as long as it includes a supported kernel and an appropriate system startup framework (e.g., **sysvinit** or **systemd**). 

Ceph has also been ported to non-Linux systems, but these ports are not officially supported by the core Ceph development team.

## Summary

- **OS Recommendations**: Ceph should run on modern, stable, and LTS Linux distributions.
- **Kernel Recommendations**: A kernel version of at least **4.19** is recommended for long-term maintenance, with **5.3** being the minimum version for RBD support.
- **Supported Distributions**: Ceph is tested and packaged for CentOS, Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, and Debian distributions. Make sure your chosen distribution meets the necessary kernel and initialization requirements for optimal performance and stability.
