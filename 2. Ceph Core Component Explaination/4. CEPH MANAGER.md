# Ceph Manager (ceph-mgr)

The **Ceph Manager (ceph-mgr)** is responsible for monitoring and managing the health and performance of the entire Ceph cluster. It checks things like storage usage, cluster health, and system load. Ceph Manager also includes tools, such as Python-based modules, for managing and displaying information about the Ceph cluster. This includes a web-based Ceph Dashboard and a REST API for programmatic access.

### Key Responsibilities:
- **Monitoring**: Tracks critical parameters like storage capacity, health, and overall performance of the cluster.
- **Management Tools**: Provides tools for managing the cluster, including:
  - **Ceph Dashboard**: A graphical user interface for interacting with the cluster.
  - **REST API**: Allows programmatic access to Ceph cluster management.
- **High Availability**: To avoid single points of failure, it's recommended to deploy at least **two Ceph Manager instances**.

# Ceph Dashboard

The **Ceph Dashboard** is a web interface that provides a visual representation of the Ceph cluster's health and status. It is an integral part of the **Ceph Manager** daemon.

### Evolution of the Ceph Dashboard:
- **In Ceph Luminous (v12.2.x)**: The Ceph Dashboard was initially introduced with basic functionality. It allowed users to view the health and status of the cluster but had minimal interactive features.
  
- **Post-Luminous Enhancements**: Over time, the Ceph Dashboard has evolved into a more feature-rich tool. New features include:
  - **Cluster health monitoring**: Real-time updates on the status of Ceph components.
  - **Performance metrics**: Graphs and charts for throughput, latency, and IOPS.
  - **Management tools**: Allows administrators to configure and manage the Ceph cluster directly from the interface.
  - **Alerting system**: Displays notifications for critical issues like disk failures, degraded components, or warnings.

### Features of the Ceph Dashboard:
- **Real-time Cluster Health**: Provides an overview of the health of the cluster and detailed information about individual components such as OSDs and monitors.
- **Visual Metrics**: Displays performance metrics and storage utilization in graphs and charts.
- **Management Interface**: Admins can add/remove OSDs, configure pools, and perform other administrative tasks from the dashboard.
- **Alerting**: Provides real-time alerts about issues such as hardware failures, degraded components, or cluster health warnings.

### Security:
The **Ceph Dashboard** supports **role-based access control (RBAC)**, which ensures that only authorized users have access to specific functionalities. Authentication methods like **LDAP**, **Kerberos**, or Ceph’s internal authentication system can be used to secure access.

## Summary

The **Ceph Manager** is a critical component of the Ceph cluster that monitors the system, manages key configurations, and ensures the cluster runs efficiently. It also provides management tools such as the **Ceph Dashboard** and **REST API** to simplify the process of maintaining and monitoring the cluster.

The **Ceph Dashboard** allows administrators to:
- Monitor the cluster’s health and performance.
- Manage configurations and perform administrative tasks through a web-based interface.
- Receive alerts and notifications about system issues.

With **Ceph Manager** and the **Ceph Dashboard**, managing a Ceph cluster becomes more intuitive and efficient, reducing reliance on the command line and enhancing overall accessibility.
