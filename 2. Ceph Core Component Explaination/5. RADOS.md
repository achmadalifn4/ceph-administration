# RADOS Gateway (RGW)

The **RADOS Gateway (RGW)** is an object storage interface built on top of **librados**, providing a RESTful gateway to **Ceph Storage Clusters**. RGW enables applications to interact with the Ceph storage system using object storage protocols. It offers compatibility with popular object storage APIs, making Ceph an attractive option for users who need scalable, distributed object storage.

## Key Features:
- **Object Storage**: RADOS Gateway (RGW) provides a distributed object storage interface for Ceph, allowing you to store and retrieve objects in a highly scalable manner.
- **API Compatibility**: RGW supports two major object storage interfaces:
  - **S3-Compatible**: Provides object storage functionality compatible with a large subset of the **Amazon S3** RESTful API. This allows users to leverage existing S3 tools, libraries, and applications to interact with Ceph.
  - **Swift-Compatible**: Provides object storage functionality compatible with a large subset of the **OpenStack Swift** API. This is beneficial for users who are using or migrating from OpenStack.

## RADOS Gateway Components:
- **RADOSGW Daemon**: The core component of the Ceph Object Gateway. It acts as an HTTP server, handling API requests and interacting with the underlying Ceph storage cluster to manage object data.
- **User Management**: Since RGW provides object storage APIs, it has its own user management system that handles authentication and authorization for access to objects and data.

## Interoperability:
- **Cross-API Namespace**: One of the key features of RGW is that the **S3 and Swift APIs share a common namespace**. This means that data written using the S3 API can be retrieved using the Swift API and vice versa. This enables flexibility and interoperability for mixed workloads.

## Benefits:
- **Unified Storage**: The Ceph Object Gateway stores data in the same Ceph storage cluster used by other Ceph clients (e.g., Ceph Block Devices, Ceph File System). This unified storage model simplifies management and enhances scalability.
- **Scalability**: Ceph's distributed nature ensures that RGW can scale out as needed to handle large amounts of object data.
- **High Availability**: RGW can be configured for high availability, ensuring that object storage is always accessible even if a node or daemon fails.

## Use Cases:
- **Backup and Archiving**: RGW provides an efficient way to store and retrieve large amounts of backup and archival data, leveraging its compatibility with S3 and Swift.
- **Cloud Storage**: For users deploying private cloud environments with OpenStack or other cloud services, RGW offers native integration with Swift and S3, enabling easy migration to or from Ceph.
- **Web Applications**: Developers can use the S3-compatible or Swift-compatible APIs to interact with Ceph storage, making RGW an ideal backend for web applications requiring scalable object storage.
