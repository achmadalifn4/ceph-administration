# Reliable Autonomic Distributed Object Store (RADOS)

RADOS (Reliable Autonomic Distributed Object Store) is the foundational layer of Ceph, providing the backbone for all user-facing services. It is designed to be a highly available, resilient, and scalable distributed object storage system, ensuring data durability and availability across all Ceph components.

## Key Features of RADOS

- **Highly Available**: RADOS is designed to provide continuous availability without a single point of failure (SPoF), making it robust for production environments.
  
- **Reliable and Resilient**: RADOS automatically handles failures by replicating data and recovering from component failures. This ensures the system can withstand hardware failures without losing data.

- **Self-Healing**: In the event of a failure (e.g., a drive or node failure), RADOS automatically repairs itself by redistributing the data across available nodes to maintain redundancy.

- **Self-Managing**: The system can autonomously manage itself, handling routine operations such as balancing data across the cluster, redistributing objects when needed, and scaling up or down without user intervention.

- **Adaptive**: RADOS adapts dynamically to changes in the cluster's size or load, adjusting as new nodes are added or removed.

- **Scalable**: RADOS is designed to scale from small deployments to massive clusters containing thousands of nodes, providing near-linear scalability.

### Core Concepts of RADOS

RADOS provides the following features that enable its robustness and efficiency:

1. **Data Distribution**: RADOS is responsible for distributing data across multiple storage devices and ensuring redundancy. It does this using the **CRUSH algorithm** (Controlled Replication Under Scalable Hashing), which efficiently places data across the cluster based on configured failure domains (e.g., racks, hosts, and disks).

2. **Fault Tolerance**: RADOS ensures that data is always replicated across different failure zones (e.g., across different racks or even data centers). If a failure occurs, the system can recover quickly by reading the data from another replica.

3. **CRUSH Algorithm**: The CRUSH algorithm is a key component of RADOS. It determines how data is distributed across the cluster, ensuring that data is replicated and balanced dynamically as the system scales. It operates without the need for a centralized metadata store, making it highly efficient and fault-tolerant.

4. **Replication & Data Integrity**: RADOS maintains multiple copies of data to ensure durability and availability. It automatically adjusts the replication factor based on the configuration to provide fault tolerance in case of disk, host, or rack failures.

5. **Dynamic Rebalancing**: As storage devices or nodes are added or removed from the system, RADOS automatically rebalances data across the cluster to ensure optimal performance and capacity utilization.

## Advantages of RADOS

- **No Single Point of Failure (SPoF)**: RADOS eliminates the risk of a single failure affecting the entire system by distributing data across multiple devices and locations.
  
- **Scalability**: The architecture can scale seamlessly from a few nodes to thousands of nodes, making it ideal for growing environments.

- **Self-Healing & Recovery**: When a failure occurs, RADOS automatically initiates recovery processes, such as replicating lost data or rebuilding degraded components, ensuring continuous availability.

- **Flexibility**: RADOS can support various storage types, including object, block, and file storage, all managed through a single unified backend.

## How RADOS Works

1. **Data is written to an object store**: Data is split into small units called objects, which are stored across multiple OSDs (Object Storage Daemons) in the Ceph cluster.

2. **CRUSH algorithm places data**: The CRUSH algorithm determines how data is placed across the cluster. It uses failure domain configuration to ensure that objects are placed across different failure zones, such as different racks or hosts.

3. **Replication**: The system ensures that objects are replicated according to the configured replication factor (typically 3 replicas). These replicas are placed across different OSDs to ensure fault tolerance.

4. **Recovery and Rebalancing**: If an OSD fails or new storage devices are added, RADOS automatically starts a recovery process. It rebalances the data across the cluster, ensuring that all data remains available and replicated.

## Conclusion

RADOS is a fundamental component of Ceph, providing the robust, fault-tolerant, and scalable storage foundation upon which the entire Ceph system is built. Its self-managing and self-healing properties make it ideal for large-scale distributed environments, offering high availability and data integrity in the face of hardware failures.

By abstracting away the complexity of data distribution and failure management, RADOS allows Ceph to provide reliable storage solutions for both cloud and on-premise environments.
