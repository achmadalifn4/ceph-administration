## Lab 2.6 - Ceph Operational (Ceph Dashboard)

**Access Ceph Dashboard**

**1. Create Ceph Dashboard User:**

   There seems to be a typo in the instruction. Instead of `ceph dashboard ac-user-create`, you should use `ceph auth add-client`.

   ```bash
   su - ceph-adm

   # Create a file named password.txt containing the desired password (keep this secure)
   echo "<your_password>" > password.txt

   # Create a Ceph client user named "admin" with administrator privileges
   sudo ceph auth add-client admin -i password.txt mon 'allow *' mgr 'allow *'
   ```

**2. Login to Ceph Dashboard (Tunneling Required):**

   The instructions mention VM tunneling details for accessing the Ceph dashboard. You'll need to establish a tunnel to the specified host (`lab16.btech.id`), port (`50002`), username (`tunnel`), and password (`gladiators88`) using your preferred tunneling tool (Terminal, Command Prompt, or Putty). 

   **Once connected through the tunnel, access the Ceph dashboard URL which might be provided elsewhere in the lab instructions.**

**3. Change Ceph Dashboard Password:**

   ```bash
   # Create another file named password.txt containing the new password
   echo "<new_password>" > password.txt

   # Use `ceph auth edit` to change the password for the client user "admin"
   sudo ceph auth edit admin -i password.txt
   ```

**Important Notes:**

* Replace `<your_password>` and `<new_password>` with your desired passwords.
* Keep the password files secure and avoid storing them in plain text.
* The provided tunneling details are specific to this lab and might not be applicable in general practice. Follow the specific instructions for your environment.
